The codes show how to evaluate the responses of a nonlinear hysteretic system under a random vibration using a deep learning method. In this example, the nonlinear hysteric system is the structure represented by a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system, while the random vibration is an earthquake ground motion. The codes are based on the paper "Kim T, Kwon OS, and Song J, 2019" published at Neural Networks. The paperâ€™s full reference information is as follows:

Kim, T., O.-S. Kwon*, and J. Song. (2019) Response Prediction of Nonlinear Hysteretic Systems by Deep Neural Networks. Neural Networks.

The example codes are developed based on Python with Keras and Tensorflow. Moreover, the user interface for estimating structural responses is provided on http://erd2.snu.ac.kr and the database (DB) can be downloaded on the site (Because the size of the DB is too large that we cannot upload on Github). Once you get the database, you can use the Python codes more properly (The URL will be soon available).

The description of the codes are as follows:
1. Generate_model.py: This code is for generating the deep neural network (DNN) model for estimating the nonlinear hysteric system under the random excitation. This is the raw model so that one can freely modify the architecture or training method to get his/her own model.

2. Simple_example.py: This code produces the structural responses (Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration) estimated from trained DNN model given customized input values. One can easily run this code by changing the "Customized input" part. The trained models are saved for '.h5' file.

3. Prediction.py: This code is an example of how to use the trained DNN models to estimate the structural responses (Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration) and database. The trained models are saved for '.h5' file.

Remark:
- The trained DNN models are able to estimate the structural responses of the SDOF system for linear, bilinear, and bilinear with hysteretic degradation (Total 54,090). Details are provided in the paper. One could freely modify the architecture of the deep neural network and use the trained models.
- Due to the size of the hysteresis (Hysteresis-Disp.npy and Hysteresis-Force.npy), we only provide the hysteresis of the linear and the bilinear SDOF systems (Total 27,090).
- However, one can also download the hysteresis of the bilinear with hysteric degradation model on http://erd2.snu.ac.kr.

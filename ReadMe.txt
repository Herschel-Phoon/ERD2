This page provides the codes and the trained models for estimating hysteric models under random excitations. Each folder indicate different methods and summaries are as follows:


1. Deterministic_Code: The structural responses (Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration) under earthquake ground motions are estimated by using deep neural network. This codes are based on the paper: Kim, T., O.-S. Kwon*, and J. Song. (2019) Response Prediction of Nonlinear Hysteretic Systems by Deep Neural Networks. Neural Networks.

2. Probabilistic_Code: Extending the deterministic DNN model by using Bayesian framework. The Probabilistic DNN model produces mean and variance of the structural responses. This codes are based on the paper: Kim, T., J. Song*, O.-S. Kwon. Probabilistic Evaluation of Seismic Responses Using Deep Learning Method (In preparation)

This page will be updated whenever new methods are developed.
